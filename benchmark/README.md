# Benchmark

The `benchmark` directory contains benchmark scripts of models and algorithms implemented in the library.
All the scripts can be launched by command line.
Every script will print an estimation of the time required to run each algorithm (in seconds) to a JSON file.
In order to run the benchmarks, install the development packages from the root directory as follows.
```bash
pip install -e .[develop]
```
